# hello_world

Hello everyone! 

I'm Lee and I'm new to this, but very excited to learn more. I've recently finished up SQL coursework and want to find some data that I can explore and analyze as a portfolio piece. I hoping to find work as a Data Intelligence Analyst as soon as I'm ready. Thanks for reading.
